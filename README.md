# Welcome to the Information Github!
Information is a software suite designed for Raspberry Pis that brings Wikipedia, books, movies, music, education, games, and more to people around the world without adequate electricity or Internet access.



Using solar-powered Raspberry Pi computers, we are trying to give people around the globe access to the information that they need.
