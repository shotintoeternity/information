# Welcome to the Information Github!
Information is a software suite designed for Raspberry Pis that brings Wikipedia, books, movies, music, education, games, and more to people around the world without adequate electricity or Internet access.

Here's the problem we're trying to solve: according to the UN Broadband Commission, 4.2 billion people in the world don't have regular access to the Internet. That's 57% of the world's population. 

Using solar-powered Raspberry Pi computers, our goal is to focus on bringing Internet content to people in the developing world to allow them to get access to the information that they need. We have created a software suite called Information that combines open-source software with our own proprietary systems to connect people worldwide.

Information turns $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W computers into offline servers that can deliver content including books, music, movies, and educational material—even Wikipedia in any language—to the people who need it most.

We use open source software including PiBakery, Kiwix, cjdns, and OpenWrt to connect people using mesh-based technology, which allows them to connect together and share critical information.
